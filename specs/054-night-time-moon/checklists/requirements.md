# Specification Quality Checklist: Night-Time Moon Variants for Sun-Depicting Icons

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed: scope was narrowed from the user's open-ended question to the one concrete, valuable gap (day/night for the 4 sun-depicting codes), with the temperature question answered directly (already handled upstream by SMHI) rather than turned into a spec item.
- New artwork itself (the 4 night-variant images) is out of scope for this spec — it covers the selection logic and mapping slot; the artwork is sourced the same way prior icon sets were.
